# 💫 About Me:
Hi, Im Vikash Kumar Gupta, a passionate self-taught full stack web developer. my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.  i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source. 📖 Self-learning is one of the most important and enjoyable parts of my life ☺️ I soon found out that GitHub is such a good place for me to record my never-ending learning journey🔥 To me, it is my open learning journal where I can not only keep my notes and references while learning new technical stuff but also share them with others who may find them helpful 📔
